# pgvector16
This repository contains a one-shot provisioning script to install PostgreSQL 16 and the pgvector extension on RHEL/CentOS (EL8). It applies conservative, production-friendly tuning aimed at LLM/RAG/vector-search workloads, enables SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, and prints ready-to-use connection credentials for an application database/user.
